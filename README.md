# Verification of Digital Designs


This is the repository for the 2020 special course on Verification of Digital Designs at DTU.

It will contain teaching material, such as slides, lab exercises, student presentations, and could also host student projects.

## Books

_Principles of Functional Verification_ by A. Meyer - a good, easy-to-read introduction to functional verification without any code examples. Considers a lot of verification-related topics and practices at a high level with illustrating figures, but with few practical examples and only little actual "_theory_". Available from [Findit](https://findit.dtu.dk/en/catalog/2305333384).

_Writing Testbenches - Functional Verification of HDL Models_ by J. Bergeron - a more in-depth overview of functional verification with examples in both Verilog and VHDL throughout the book. This book is more university textbook-like than the above, and despite the difference in language from the course, it still represents a good source. Available from [Findit](https://findit.dtu.dk/en/catalog/2441585752).

_Fundamentals of Digital Logic with VHDL Desgin_ by S. Brown, Z. Vranesic. Chapter 11 offers techniques for making effective test sets using stuck-at models. These techniques includes identifying input combinations which will test the entire design using logic tables and sensitized paths. The chapter also makes remarks of making designs for testiability and BISTs. Avaible from [Academia](https://www.academia.edu/6406951/Fundamentals_of_Digital_Logic_with_VHDL_Design).

_ASIC/SoC Functional Design Verification_ by A. B. Mehta. The book serves as a guide to technologies and methodologies of functional design verification, including UVM. Available from [Findit](https://findit.dtu.dk/en/catalog/2374482012).

_How to Choose verification methodology_ by R. Purisai. This article starts out by comparing Verification and validation(test). In part 1.3 the author describes various types of testing strategies, and talks about trends within the field of testing. In part 1.4 the author offers some ideas in terms of choosing the right verification methodology.
