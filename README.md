This is the repository for the 2020 special course on Verification of Digital Designs at DTU.

It will contain teaching material, such as slides, lab exercises, student presentations, and could also host student projects.

## Books

_Principles of Functional Verification_ by A. Meyer - a good, easy-to-read introduction to functional verification without any code examples. Considers a lot of verification-related topics and practices at a high level with illustrating figures, but with few practical examples and only little actual "_theory_". Available from [Findit](https://findit.dtu.dk/en/catalog/2305333384).

_Writing Testbenches - Functional Verification of HDL Models_ - a more in-depth overview of functional verification with examples in both Verilog and VHDL throughout the book. This book is more university textbook-like than the above, and despite the difference in language from the course, it still represents a good source. Available from [Findit](https://findit.dtu.dk/en/catalog/2441585752).
